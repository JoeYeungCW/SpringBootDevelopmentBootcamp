In this workbook, I have learnt REST API and set the "GET", "POST", "PUT", and "DELETE" for the contact application. I put the CURD function code inside the repository,
and create a server interface, and put the code in server implementation.

I have applied the exception for prevent the internal server error, before applied the exception, when I input the id which is not exist, the application will show the internal server error and the server will crashed.

After I add the exception, the application will show 404 error when I input the wrong id, and it prevent the internal server error and the crash of server.
