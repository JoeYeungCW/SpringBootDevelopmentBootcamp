In workbook 8.1, I have learnt exception can prevent the crash of the application, but in last workbook I need to throws, try, and catch in each function which require the user to input the id, it is really annoying and very easy to make a mistake when we need to change the code.

So in this workbook I learnt the unchecked exception (run time exception) can choose to not throw and use a handler to handle the run time exception.
