This workbook is to display the sale record. First of all, I have create the "Record" class and the array to store the data. But when I set the data type as "double", the digit numbers are too much for this case. And the reason is because "double" is certain precision.

After I change the data type by double to BigDecimal, the digit of number are show correctly.

And I have also change the color of the table, when the profit>=0, the color would be green, otherwise it would be red to make the table more readable.
